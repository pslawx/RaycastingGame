# RayCasting Game
This is a study project based on the Wolfenstein concept with Doom sprites, using the Pygame framework in Python, with personal modifications to the rendering method and calculations.

This study helped me understand advanced calculations involving sprite distortions and positions relative to the player’s point of view. It also taught me about NPC rendering methods and priority rendering, as well as the rendering limits for walls, objects, and NPCs. It’s a great project for study.
